Iris Flower Prediction.

This project classifies Iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. It leverages supervised machine learning classification techniques.
Predict the species of an Iris flower given its sepal and petal measurements using classification algorithms.
